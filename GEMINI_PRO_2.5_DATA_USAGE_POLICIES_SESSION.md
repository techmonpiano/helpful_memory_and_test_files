# Gemini Pro 2.5 Data Usage Policies Research Session

**Date**: 2025-09-09  
**Session Type**: Research & Information Gathering  
**Topic**: Data usage policies for Gemini Pro 2.5 when accessed via paid API vs third-party services like Pareto Tess

## Session Overview

User inquired about whether Google uses personal data when accessing Gemini Pro 2.5 through:
1. Direct paid API access
2. Third-party services like Pareto Tess AI

## Key Findings

### 1. Gemini Pro 2.5 Direct Paid API Usage

**Data Usage Policies:**
- **FREE SERVICES**: Google explicitly uses data to train/improve models
- **PAID API**: Much more restrictive - Google does NOT use customer content for training without explicit permission
- **Training Restriction**: Google won't use paid API data to train or fine-tune AI/ML models without prior permission

**What Google Does Collect (Paid API):**
- Account/billing information
- Usage metrics (token counts, performance data)  
- Technical operational data (IP addresses, error reports)
- Prompts, contextual information, and outputs (retained 55 days for abuse monitoring)

**Data Retention Options:**
- Default: 24-hour caching for performance (can be disabled)
- Zero data retention available by disabling caching
- 55-day retention for abuse monitoring (non-negotiable)

**Privacy Commitments:**
- Google follows AI/ML privacy commitment for enterprise cloud services
- Controller-Controller Data Protection Terms apply
- Strong separation between free and paid service data usage

### 2. Pareto Tess AI Service Analysis

**Service Overview:**
- Platform providing access to 200+ AI models
- Includes Gemini 2.0, ChatGPT, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1-mini
- Ranked #6 globally in G2's 2024 Best AI Software list
- Pricing: Access to $200+ worth of AI models for $20/user

**Pareto Tess Data Policies:**
- **No Training Promise**: Explicitly states no customer data used for AI training
- **No Model Improvement**: Customer prompts/responses not used to improve their models
- **Content Ownership**: All generated content exclusively owned by client (Business/Enterprise plans)
- **Third-party Protection**: Requires high security standards from connected AI providers

**Security Standards:**
- SOC II Type 1 & 2 compliance
- SSO support
- End-to-end encryption
- Dedicated secure servers for enterprise

**Critical Consideration - Third-party Data Sharing:**
- Tess clearly discloses data sharing with underlying AI models
- Users must explicitly consent during login
- Privacy protection = Tess policies + underlying model provider policies
- Data still flows to Google's Gemini API with Google's privacy protections

- **Medium Risk**: Pareto Tess (dual policies apply)
- **Highest Risk**: Free Google AI services (explicit training use)

## Technical Details Discovered

### Google's Data Retention Specifics:
- **Abuse Monitoring**: 55 days (non-negotiable)
- **Performance Caching**: 24 hours (can be disabled for zero retention)
- **Metadata Collection**: Account info, usage metrics, technical logs

### Pareto Tess Technical Stack:
