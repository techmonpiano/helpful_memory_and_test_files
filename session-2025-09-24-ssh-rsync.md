# Session Memory: SSH & Rsync File Transfer
**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Duration:** Extended session  
**Systems:** ubuntu1-ash2-vm (local) ↔ runtipi1.tail1da69.ts.net (remote)

## Session Overview
This session involved establishing persistent SSH connections and performing large-scale file transfers with rsync, preserving all file properties and handling permission challenges.

## 1. SSH Session Establishment

### Task
Create persistent SSH session to remote server for ongoing operations.

### Implementation
```bash
ssh user1@runtipi1.tail1da69.ts.net
```

### Results
- **Process ID:** 1936
- **Connection Status:** Successfully connected
- **Remote System:** Debian GNU/Linux 6.12.12+bpo-amd64
- **Session Type:** Persistent, maintained throughout session
- **Runtime:** 641+ seconds (over 10 minutes active)

### Technical Notes
- Connection established using Desktop Commander MCP process management
- Session remained stable throughout file transfer operations
- No authentication issues encountered

## 2. Rsync File Transfer Operations

### Objective
Transfer entire ~/docker directory from remote server to local system while preserving all file properties, permissions, ownership, and timestamps.

### Initial Command
```bash
rsync -avz --progress user1@runtipi1.tail1da69.ts.net:~/docker/ ~/docker/
```

### Command Parameters Explained
- `-a` (archive mode): Preserves permissions, ownership, timestamps, symlinks
- `-v` (verbose): Shows detailed transfer progress
- `-z` (compress): Compresses data during transfer for efficiency
- `--progress`: Displays real-time transfer statistics
- Source: `user1@runtipi1.tail1da69.ts.net:~/docker/`
- Destination: `~/docker/`

### Transfer Process Details
- **Initial Process ID:** 2012
- **Verification Process ID:** 2119 
- **Total Transfer Size:** 6,973,443,861 bytes (~6.97 GB)
- **Transfer Rate:** 1,120,332.31 bytes/sec average

### Directories Successfully Transferred
1. `.claude/` - Claude settings and configurations
2. `appflowy/` - Complete AppFlowy project with Git repository
3. `cloudflared_dockerized/`
4. `docker-claude-code/`
5. `guacamole/`
6. `mattermost-stack/`
7. `mattermost-stack-fork/`
8. `nextcloud-aio/`
9. `nextcloudstack/`
10. `nginxpm/`

### Permission Issues Encountered
During transfer, several permission denied errors occurred:

```bash
rsync: [sender] send_files failed to open "/home/user1/docker/mattermost-stack-fork/server/server/mattermost.log": Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/mattermost-stack-fork/server/server/data" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/nextcloudstack/ssl/hpb/accounts" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/nextcloudstack/ssl/hpb/archive" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/nextcloudstack/ssl/hpb/live" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/nginxpm/letsencrypt/accounts" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/nginxpm/letsencrypt/archive" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/nginxpm/letsencrypt/live" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] opendir "/home/user1/docker/nginxpm/postgres" failed: Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] send_files failed to open "/home/user1/docker/nextcloudstack/ssl/hpb/privkey.pem": Permission denied (13)
rsync: [sender] send_files failed to open "/home/user1/docker/nginxpm/letsencrypt/credentials/credentials-1": Permission denied (13)
```

### Failed File Categories
- SSL certificates and private keys
- Let's Encrypt account/archive/live directories  
- Database files (postgres directories)
- Application logs and runtime data
- Credentials files

### Proposed Solution
**Recommended Fix:** Use root account access for complete transfer:
```bash
rsync -avz --progress root@runtipi1.tail1da69.ts.net:/home/user1/docker/ ~/docker/
```

### Transfer Verification
- **File Properties Preserved:** ✅ Confirmed via file info checks
- **Permissions:** Files show correct 644, directories show 755  
- **Timestamps:** Original modification dates maintained
- **Complete Git Repository:** Full .git directory with history preserved
- **Configuration Files:** All Docker Compose files transferred

#### Example Verification
```bash
# File: ~/docker/appflowy/.env
size: 16440
permissions: 644
modified: Wed Sep 10 2025 15:03:05 GMT-0400 (Original timestamp preserved)
```

## 3. System Configuration Changes

### Permanent DISPLAY Variable Setup
Modified user's shell configuration to support VNC environment:

#### File Modified: `/home/user1/.bashrc`
**Addition made at end of file:**
```bash
# Set DISPLAY for VNC session
export DISPLAY=:1
```

#### Implementation Details
- **Edit Location:** Appended to existing .bashrc after sudo wrapper function
- **Purpose:** Support GUI application launches in VNC environment
- **Activation:** Requires `source ~/.bashrc` or terminal restart

## 4. Technical Lessons Learned

### File Transfer Best Practices
1. **Use Root Access:** For complete system transfers including sensitive files
2. **Verify Permissions:** Always check what files failed to transfer
3. **Multiple Passes:** Run rsync twice to ensure completeness
4. **Progress Monitoring:** Use --progress flag for large transfers

### Desktop Commander Process Management
1. **Persistent Sessions:** Processes maintain state across operations
2. **Process Monitoring:** Use list_sessions to track active processes  
3. **Large Output Handling:** Some operations exceed token limits, requiring pagination
4. **Timeout Management:** Long-running processes need appropriate timeout values

## 5. Command Reference

### SSH Connection
```bash
ssh user1@runtipi1.tail1da69.ts.net
```

### Complete File Transfer (with root access)
```bash
rsync -avz --progress root@runtipi1.tail1da69.ts.net:/home/user1/docker/ ~/docker/
```

## 6. Process IDs & Session Details

| Process | PID  | Purpose | Duration | Status |
|---------|------|---------|----------|---------|
| SSH Session | 1936 | Remote connection | 641+ seconds | Active |
| Rsync Transfer 1 | 2012 | Initial file sync | 146 seconds | Completed |
| Rsync Verification | 2119 | Final sync check | 12 seconds | Completed |

## 7. File System Impact

### New Directory Created
- `/home/user1/memory-bank/` - Documentation storage

### Modified Files
- `/home/user1/.bashrc` - Added DISPLAY export

### Transferred Content
- Complete `~/docker/` directory structure (6.97 GB)
- 10 major application directories
- Configuration files, Docker Compose files, Git repositories
- Partial transfer of sensitive files (SSL certs, database files)
