# Python Terminal Libraries Analysis - 2025

## GitHub Stars Ranking (Approximate)

1. **Rich** - ~47,000+ stars (most popular)
   - Beautiful terminal formatting, tables, progress bars, syntax highlighting
   - Primarily for output formatting, no interactive text selection

2. **Textual** - ~25,000 stars
   - Full TUI framework built on Rich, event-driven applications
   - Provides some text selection widgets but limited editor-style behavior

3. **Click** - ~15,000 stars
   - Command-line interface creation toolkit
   - No text selection capabilities (CLI focus)

4. **prompt_toolkit** - ~9,000 stars
   - Library for building powerful interactive command line applications
   - **Best text selection support** with built-in Shift+Arrow, Shift+Home/End navigation

5. **Pexpect** - ~2,700 stars
   - Spawns/controls child processes, includes ANSI terminal emulator
   - Terminal emulation focus, not interactive text editing

6. **blessed** - ~1,400 stars
   - Easy, practical library for making python terminal apps
   - Low-level, would require custom implementation for text selection

7. **pyte** - ~650 stars
   - VT100-compatible terminal emulator, screen scraping
   - Terminal emulation focus, not interactive text editing

## Text Selection with Editor-Style Behavior

### Libraries with Text Selection Support

**prompt_toolkit** - Best Option
- Built-in support for Shift+Arrow, Shift+Home/End navigation
- Mouse support for cursor positioning and scrolling
- Auto suggestions (like fish shell)
- Multiple input buffers

**Textual** - Limited Support
- Some text selection widgets available
- Event-driven framework allows custom implementation
- Built on Rich for terminal formatting

### Libraries Requiring Custom Implementation

**blessed/curses** - Low-level terminal control
- Keyboard input handling and cursor positioning
- Would need custom selection state tracking
- Manual implementation of Shift+key combinations

**Rich** - Output formatting only
- No interactive text selection capabilities
- Primarily for displaying formatted content

**pyte/pexpect** - Terminal emulation
- Focus on terminal emulation, not text editing
- Would require significant custom work for selection

## Key Findings

1. **Most Popular**: Rich dominates with 47k+ stars but lacks text selection
2. **Best for Text Selection**: prompt_toolkit is the clear winner for editor-style behavior
3. **Unique Implementation**: HandyTerm project appears to be one of the few Python terminal emulators that successfully combines real terminal functionality with full text editor selection behavior (Shift+Arrow, Shift+Home/End)
4. **Market Gap**: Most libraries focus on either terminal emulation OR text editing, rarely both

## Library Categories

### Terminal UI Frameworks
- **Rich** - Formatting and display
- **Textual** - Full TUI applications
- **blessed** - Terminal capabilities wrapper

### Command Line Tools
- **Click** - CLI creation
- **prompt_toolkit** - Interactive command line apps

### Terminal Emulation
- **pyte** - VT100 terminal emulator
- **Pexpect** - Process control with terminal emulation

### Standard Library
- **curses** - Low-level terminal handling

## Conclusion

For projects requiring text editor-style selection behavior in terminals, prompt_toolkit is the best existing option. However, most terminal emulator libraries don't provide this functionality natively, making HandyTerm's implementation particularly valuable in the Python ecosystem.
