# Grep and Replace Tools Analysis Session

**Date:** 2025-08-27  
**Session Type:** Research and Analysis  
**Topic:** Find-and-Replace Tool Options for LLMs

## Session Overview

This session focused on exploring different approaches for find-and-replace operations, particularly for LLMs that may not have access to dedicated tools or MCP servers. The discussion covered native Linux utilities, tool combinations, and fuzzy matching capabilities.

## Key Findings

### 1. Tool Hierarchy for Find-and-Replace

**MCP Tools (When Available):**
- Primary: `mcp__desktop-commander__search_code` with filters
- Primary: `mcp__desktop-commander__edit_block` for precise replacements
- Advantages: Context-aware, safe, integrated workflow

**Native Linux Tools (Fallback):**
- Best combo: `grep + sed` with verification
- Reliable: `find + sed` for recursive operations
- Modern: `ripgrep + sd` for enhanced performance

### 2. Recommended Workflow for LLMs Without Tools

```bash
# 1. Find and preview matches first
grep -rn "oldFunction" . --include="*.py"

# 2. Show context to verify correctness  
grep -rn -C2 "oldFunction" . --include="*.py"

# 3. Replace with backup (CRITICAL for safety)
find . -name "*.py" -exec sed -i.bak 's/oldFunction/newFunction/g' {} \;

# 4. Verify changes
grep -rn "newFunction" . --include="*.py"
```

### 3. Tool Capabilities Matrix

| Tool | Fuzzy Search | Fuzzy Replace | Backup Support | Context |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|---------|
| MCP search_code | ✅ (regex, ignoreCase) | ❌ | N/A | ✅ |
| MCP edit_block | N/A | ❌ (exact match) | ✅ (automatic) | ✅ |
| grep | ✅ (regex, -i) | N/A | N/A | ✅ (-C) |
| sed | ❌ (exact/regex only) | ❌ | ✅ (-i.bak) | ❌ |
| agrep | ✅ (approximate) | N/A | N/A | ✅ |
| ripgrep | ✅ (regex, -i) | N/A | N/A | ✅ (-C) |

### 4. Fuzzy Matching Limitations

**Key Discovery:** No mainstream tool provides true "fuzzy replacement"
- **sed:** Exact pattern matching only (with regex support)
- **MCP edit_block:** Requires exact string matching
- **Fuzzy search exists:** grep -i, ripgrep, agrep for approximate finding
- **Solution:** Fuzzy search → manual verification → precise replacement

### 5. Safety Best Practices

**Critical Safety Measures:**
1. **Always preview before replacing:** Use grep with context (-C2)
2. **Create backups:** sed -i.bak or MCP's automatic versioning
3. **Verify after changes:** grep for new patterns
4. **Test on single file first:** Before batch operations

## Alternative Tool Options

### Modern Alternatives
- **sd:** Modern sed replacement with better syntax
- **ripgrep + sd:** Fast search and replace combo
- **GNU parallel:** For performance on large codebases
- **perl one-liners:** For complex regex replacements

### Interactive Options
- **fzf:** Fuzzy finder for manual selection
- **agrep:** Approximate pattern matching
- **Interactive sed:** With confirmation prompts

## Session Outcome

**Primary Recommendation for LLMs:**
Use `grep + sed` workflow with backup verification as the most reliable fallback when dedicated tools aren't available.

**Key Insight:**
The concept of "fuzzy replacement" doesn't exist in standard Unix tools - they all require precise pattern specification, even when search can be fuzzy.

**Best Practice:**
Always separate the search phase (which can be fuzzy) from the replace phase (which must be precise).

## Related Files and Context

- Working directory: `/home/user1/shawndev1`
- Git repo context: Current branch `rebuild/after-e023d9d`
- CLAUDE.md instructions emphasize MCP tools first, then native tools as fallback

## Future Considerations

- Consider building custom fuzzy replacement tools for LLM workflows
- Explore ML-based code transformation tools
- Investigate language server protocol tools for semantic replacements
