# Coffee Brewing Guide - Strong Coffee

## Quick Cheat Sheet
*For strong brewed coffee (each "cup" = 6 oz serving)*

| Brewed Coffee | Water | Ground Coffee Needed |
|---------------|-------|---------------------|
| 4 cups | 24 oz | **0.5-0.6 cups** (8-10 tbsp) |
| 6 cups | 36 oz | **0.75 cups** (12 tbsp) |
| 8 cups | 48 oz | **1 cup** (16 tbsp) |
| 10 cups | 60 oz | **1.25 cups** (20 tbsp) |
| 12 cups | 72 oz | **1-1.25 cups** (16-20 tbsp) |
| 14 cups | 84 oz | **1.4-1.5 cups** (22-24 tbsp) |

## Basic Conversions
- **1 cup = 16 tablespoons**
- **0.75 cup (3/4 cup) = 12 tablespoons**
- **0.25 cup (1/4 cup) = 4 tablespoons**

---

## Coffee Strength Guidelines

### Regular Strength
- 1-2 tablespoons per 6 oz cup

### Strong Coffee
- 2-3 tablespoons per 6 oz cup

### The Golden Ratio
- **2 tablespoons** of ground coffee per **6 ounces** of water

## Small Batch vs Large Batch Brewing

**Important Discovery:** The coffee-to-water ratio changes depending on batch size!

### Small Batch (2-6 cups)
- Use **stronger ratio**: 1:14 to 1:16
- Need **MORE coffee per cup** than large batches
- Reason: Less efficient extraction with smaller volumes

### Large Batch (10-14 cups)
- Use **lighter ratio**: 1:15 to 1:18
- Can use **LESS coffee per cup** than small batches
- Reason: Larger volumes extract more efficiently due to longer contact time
- Also benefits from coarser grind to compensate for extended extraction time

### Practical Example
For **72 oz of water** (12 cups):
- Simple calculation: 12 cups Ã— 2 tbsp = 24 tbsp = 1.5 cups
- **Adjusted for large batch**: 1-1.25 cups is sufficient for strong coffee
- Using 1:17 or 1:18 ratio works well for full flavor

## Session Notes - 2025-10-20

1. Started with basic conversions (tablespoons to cups)
2. Discussed strong coffee ratios (2 tbsp per 6 oz cup)
3. Calculated 72 oz batch initially as 1.5 cups
4. Researched small vs large batch differences
5. Discovered that large batches can use less coffee per cup due to better extraction efficiency
