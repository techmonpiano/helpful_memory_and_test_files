# Wave Terminal and Apache License 2.0 Guide

## Wave Terminal Overview

Wave Terminal (formerly Waveterm) is an open-source, cross-platform terminal emulator with advanced features that address the text editor-like selection and cursor positioning needs.

### Key Features:
- **Integrated Monaco Editor** (VS Code's editor) for inline file editing
- **Full text editor capabilities**: syntax highlighting, code completion, find/replace
- **Cross-platform support**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Rich UI features**: file previews, workspace organization, AI integration
- **Open source** under Apache License 2.0

### Why Wave Terminal Solves the Click-to-Position Problem:
Unlike traditional terminal emulators (including xterm.js), Wave Terminal integrates actual text editing capabilities through Monaco editor, providing true click-to-position cursor functionality and text editor-like selection behavior.

## Alternative Terminal Emulators Research Summary

### Terminals with Enhanced Selection Features:

1. **DomTerm**
   - ONLY terminal supporting true click-to-position cursor
   - Challenge: Requires compiling from source
   - Works even with bash

2. **Micro Editor** 
   - Terminal-based text editor (not emulator)
   - Full mouse support: click positioning, drag selection
   - Works inside any terminal

3. **Extraterm**
   - Distinct "Text Editor" mode
   - Advanced selection capabilities
   - Different context modes

### Modern GPU-Accelerated Terminals (2024):
- **Kitty**: Lowest latency (29.2ms), best performance
- **WezTerm**: Best features, native tabs/scrollbars, higher memory use
- **Alacritty**: Minimal, fast, but lacks some features

### Current Technical Limitations:
Traditional terminal architecture separates display (terminal emulator) from cursor control (shell/apps), making true click-to-position cursor nearly impossible in standard terminals. Only DomTerm has solved this at the terminal level.

## Recommendations

### For Text Editor-Like Terminal Experience:
1. **Wave Terminal** - Best integrated solution with real text editing
2. **Micro Editor** - Use inside any terminal for text editor behavior
3. **DomTerm** - If you need true terminal click-to-position

### For Your Current Project:
- Wave Terminal would provide the exact functionality you want out-of-the-box
- No need to implement complex workarounds in xterm.js
- Free for all use including commercial/business

## Conclusion

Wave Terminal under Apache 2.0 license provides a free, business-friendly solution that delivers the text editor-like selection and click-to-position cursor functionality you're seeking. It eliminates the need for complex custom implementations while providing a modern, feature-rich terminal experience.
