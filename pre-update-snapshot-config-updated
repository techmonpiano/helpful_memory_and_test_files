# Configuration for pre-update-snapshot.sh
# Copy this file to /etc/default/pre-update-snapshot to customize behavior

# Log file location
#LOG_FILE="/var/log/auto-update-snapshots.log"

# Minimum free disk space percentage required for snapshots
#MIN_FREE_SPACE_PERCENT=10

# Maximum time to wait for existing processes to complete (in seconds)
#PROCESS_WAIT_TIMEOUT=300

# Interactive timeout for snapshot operations and user prompts (in seconds)
# This is the timeout for both snapshot tool execution and waiting for user input
#INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT=30

# Enable interactive prompts when snapshots fail or timeout (true/false)
# When true, the script will prompt the user to bypass snapshots if they fail
# When false, the script will follow non-interactive behavior
#ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_PROMPT=true

# Allow skipping snapshots in certain conditions (true/false)
# When true, the script will proceed without snapshots if:
# - SKIP_SNAPSHOTS environment variable is set
# - Not on BTRFS filesystem
# - All snapshot tools fail but system needs to proceed
#ALLOW_SKIP_SNAPSHOTS=false

# Kill processes that have been running for more than 1 hour (true/false)
# Use with caution - only enable if you're confident stuck processes should be killed
#KILL_STUCK_PROCESSES=false

# Example usage:
# To temporarily skip snapshots for one operation:
#   SKIP_SNAPSHOTS=1 apt install package-name
#
# To allow the system to proceed without snapshots when tools fail:
#   Set ALLOW_SKIP_SNAPSHOTS=true in this file
#
# To disable interactive prompts (for automated systems):
#   Set ENABLE_INTERACTIVE_PROMPT=false in this file
#
# To change the timeout for snapshot operations:
#   Set INTERACTIVE_TIMEOUT=60 for longer timeout (60 seconds)
