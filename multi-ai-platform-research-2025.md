# Multi-AI Platform Research 2025 ü§ñ
*Comprehensive analysis of platforms providing access to GPT-4, Claude, Mistral, and other AI models*

## üìã Executive Summary

After extensive research across Reddit, GitHub, and platform documentation, here are the key findings for multi-AI platforms in 2025:

### üèÜ Top Recommendations by Use Case:
- **Best Value:** WritingMate.ai (unlimited free-tier models, $9.99-29.99/month)
- **Fastest Performance:** Groq.com (18x faster inference, generous free tier)
- **Most Generous Credits:** Modal.com ($30/month + up to $50k for startups)

## üîç Detailed Platform Analysis

### Modal.com - The Developer's Choice
**$30 Monthly Credits Analysis**

‚úÖ **What's Included:**
- $30/month in general compute credits (not LLM-specific)
- Works for both GPU and CPU serverless compute
- Pay-per-second billing - only charged when code runs
- Startups get up to $50k additional credits
- No separation between LLM inference and general compute pricing

‚úÖ **Pros:**
- Truly serverless - scale to hundreds of GPUs in seconds
- Cost-effective for variable workloads
- Recent 15-30% price cuts on GPUs/CPUs
- One user noted "$30 free credit could power our use for quite some time"

‚ùå **Cons:**
- More technical setup required
- Not a traditional chat interface

**Best For:** Developers, variable AI workloads, LLM fine-tuning

---

### Abacus.AI DeepAgent - The Reality Check
**Credit Consumption Analysis**

‚ùå **The Harsh Truth:**
- **DeepAgent tasks:** 120,000-275,000 credits each
- **Monthly allocation:** 20,000 ($10) or 25,000 ($20) credits
- **Math:** $10 plan = less than 1 complex task
- **Real user quote:** *"7 million computer points needed and one single front web app window couldn't be finished"*

üìä **Pricing Breakdown:**
- Basic Plan: $10/month (20,000 credits) - only 3 DeepAgent tasks
- Pro Plan: $20/month (25,000 credits) - "unrestricted" access (still credit-limited)
- **Reality:** Expect $50-100+/month for serious usage

‚ö†Ô∏è **User Complaints:**
- *"It does chew your compute credits up much faster"*
- *"Can become expensive for startups or small businesses"*
- Auto-billing when credits run out

**Verdict:** NOT generous despite marketing claims
