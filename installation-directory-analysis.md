# Installation Directory Analysis

## Overview
This application follows standard Linux directory conventions (XDG Base Directory Specification and Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) for organizing installed files.

## Directory Usage

### ~/.local/ Directory
Used for application code, data, and resources (relatively static content):

- **~/.local/bin/** - Executable files and scripts
- **~/.local/share/** - Application data, resources, and shared files
- **~/.local/lib/** - Libraries, modules, and application components

### ~/.config/ Directory  
Used for user configuration files (frequently modified content):

- User-modifiable configuration files
- Settings and preferences
- Application-specific configuration data

## Design Principles

The separation follows these key principles:

1. **Immutable vs Mutable**: `.local` contains relatively static application files, while `.config` contains user-modifiable settings
2. **Backup Strategy**: Users can backup configurations separately from application data
3. **Standards Compliance**: Follows established Linux standards (XDG Base Directory Specification)
4. **User Experience**: Separates what users typically modify from what they don't

## Benefits

- **Clean Organization**: Clear separation between application code and user settings
- **Portability**: Configuration files can be easily backed up and transferred
- **Standards Adherence**: Follows Linux filesystem conventions
- **Maintenance**: Easier to manage updates (application files vs user preferences)

## Cross-Platform Considerations

The application includes cross-platform support and migration capabilities from legacy directory locations, ensuring compatibility across different operating systems while maintaining proper directory organization on Linux systems.
